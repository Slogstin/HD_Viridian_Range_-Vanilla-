# Description
This Addon adds a completely new Firing Range to [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor). 

A version for use with [Ugky as Sin](https://github.com/caligari87/Ugly-as-Sin) can be found [here](https://github.com/Slogstin/HD_Viridian_Range_-UaS-)!

The new Range does not replace the old one and both are acessible at all times!

# Lore

    "We are proud to finally be able to open the Viridian Firing range for all UAC Marines!
    This range has been serving as a kind of Hub for our Mercenaries during it's construction and after their continuous 
    feedback, we are finally confident enough to open it for our allies from the UAC!
    Feel free to prepare yourself for the next mission and warm up while you're waiting for your friends!
    This doesn't mean that we're done yet! There are still many things to improve.
    But those improvements will slowly trickle in. For now...
    Enjoy your stay! Also, be sure to talk to Jim at the Info Stand!  -Your VIRID Inc. Construction Team"
